                    <h1>Our Work</h1>
                    <p>The concept is simple: you register your intent, you pick a local spot that would benefit from a litter pick, you grab your work colleagues, employees or team and then you dedicate 2 or more hours to cleaning that area up.
                        The initiative has been highly successful in Australia with teams helping to clear tonnes of rubbish from local community and tourist areas. And you donâ€™t have to wait until next year to get started. Arrange a date and time that suits you and your colleagues and get stuck in.
                        Dumpster Area Clean Up. One of our biggest services is dumpster area clean up. Sometimes the top doesn't shut properly, wind blows debris out the top,
                        the dumpster was overflowing before the last pick up, or maybe someone missed the opening.

                        recurring basis to keep your locations meeting your expectations.
